# buggengo

This tool was intended for use with a modified SWE-smith to assist in generating training data for Go code.

It provides output to support the [Rewrite strategy described in the SWE-smith
documentation](https://swesmith.com/guides/create_instances/).

It is no longer necessary now that [tree-sitter based Go support has been merged into
SWE-smith](https://github.com/SWE-bench/SWE-smith/pull/28).
